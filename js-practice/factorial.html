        Definition
Strong number is the number that the sum of the factorial of its digits is equal to number itself.

For example : 145 , since
1! + 4! + 5! = 1 + 24 + 120 = 145
So, 145 is a Strong number.

Task
Given a number, Find if it is Strong or not .

Warm-up (Highly recommended)
Playing With Numbers Series
Notes
Number passed is always Positive .
Return the result as String

Input >> Output Examples
1- strong_num (1)  ==> return "STRONG!!!!"
Explanation:
Since , the sum of its digits' factorial of (1) is equal to number itself (1) , Then its a Strong .

2- strong_num (123) ==> return "Not Strong !!"
Explanation:
Since , the sum of its digits' factorial of 1! + 2! + 3! = 9 is not equal to number itself (123) , Then it's Not Strong .

3- strong_num (2)  ==>  return "STRONG!!!!"
Explanation:
Since , the sum of its digits' factorial of 2! = 2 is equal to number itself (2) , Then its a Strong .

4- strong_num (150) ==> return "Not Strong !!"
Explanation:
Since , the sum of its digits' factorial of 1! + 5! + 0! = 122 is not equal to number itself (150) , Then it's Not Strong .
